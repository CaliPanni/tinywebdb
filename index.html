This demonstration Web service is designed to work with <a
href="http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about">App Inventor
for Android</a> and the TinyWebDB component.  The site is designed
for use by applications running on the phone (via JSON requests).  You
can also invoke the get and store operations by hand from this Web
page to test the API, and also delete individual entries.</p>

<p>This service is only a demo. The database will store at most 2000
entries; adding entries beyond that will cause the oldest entries to
be deleted.  Also, individual data values are limited to at most 500 characters.</p>

<p>The source code for this service, designed to run on Google AppEngine, is included in the 
App Inventor documentation. You can use this implementation as a model for deploying
your own services with larger capacity and additional features, and
build applications that use the TinyWebDB component to talk to your
service.</p> </td> </tr> </table>
